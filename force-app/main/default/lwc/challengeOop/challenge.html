    <p>
        Hi, I'm Matari Howard, the founder of Salesforce Digital. I'm passionate about combining educational fun games with a message of social good. Through software development, I aim to create innovative, clever gaming alerts that raises awareness about the effects of violence in games and promotes a positive change in our gaming community. My goal is to offer behavior alrets and warning signals when profanity of excessive noise is detected while playing violent and graphic video games.
